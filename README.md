# Git 'R Dun

## Purpose

The app will allow people to easily and efficiently organize household responsibilities with a collection
of lists that are sharable and editable by all household members.

## Main Features

The standard app will come with 3 primary built in lists: grocery, chores and a miscellaneous to-do.

Users will be able to:

* Sign up/sign in/sign out of a personalized account
* Share access to their lists with other users
* Add and delete from all lists
* Users can mark tasks as repeatable daily/weekly/monthly

## Future Features

* Creation of custom lists
* Signature with a date stamp and user initial or icon that appears when an item is crossed off so others can see who marked it off.
* Tracking that aggregates statistics about daily/weekly/monthly that collects accomplishments
* Optional email notifications of reports
* Optional notifications when list items are added and/or removed
